# Loyola University Coding Challenge

This is my recreation of one of Loyola University's pages using React. 

Please find the figma mockups of my designs [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ToFnt0kSakJdTMpirWQaaw/loyola?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=87TFiac9goWv6097-1).

Additionally, please find screenshots of the app for a quick view at the end of this Readme.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
